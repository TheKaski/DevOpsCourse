Findings from this excercise:
1. New Golang language
2. Multi stage docker images with Golang
3. Basic http servers with both python and golang
4. Working with VM

I learned very basics of new language Go which was interesting. I tinkered with new concepts of docker containers and linux
I learned that Go supposrts multi stage docker containers which allows it to create very minimal images which could be useful
for microservices. I implemented all the http servers with new language and created additional "realtime" dashboard with 
text based data stream in html. This can be accessed from /gui endpoint. It was my own test as I was curious to see how I could use
the information gathered from the images.  I also learned more about working with VMsI set up a Debian minimal VM for this excercise
in virtualbox and some problems I faced for example were slow internet speeds which I managed to debug and improve succesfully
as well as installing packages and runing docker commands.
